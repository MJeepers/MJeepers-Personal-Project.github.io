    <h1>What is Personal Project?</h1>
	<p>
Personal Project is a part of the MYP cycle in the IB curriculum, where Grade 10 students explore an area of intrest (for me it was Mental health and Game development) and develop the intrest into a product or a result that complete their product goal and help educate them in whatever learning goal they had in mind.
<br><br>
"MYP students in their final year explore an area of personal interest over an extended period. It provides them the opportunity to consolidate their learning and develop important skills they’ll need in both further education and life beyond the classroom. It also helps them develop confidence to become principled, lifelong learners."

    <h1>The Purpose of my Product.</h1>
	<p>
For my project, my goal was to spread awerness on an evergrowing issue of mental health (not schisophrenia specifically. My game is about schisophrenia because I thought it was the best way to convey my message.) and aid others dealing with these kinds of issues, by helping them speak up and say what they are going through, even if thier not entirley sure. It is important to help these people wherever you find them, whether that be a friend or family member or even someone you dont really talk to thats feeling down. It is important to tell these people are cared about and loved. All in all, this is why my goal relates to the never ending issue of mental health.
<br><br>
The reason why I decided to use the medium of a psycological horror game, is because the majority of of indivisuals who play video games are usually teenagers (14-21 years old) which is also the most comman age for “50% of all lifetimes mental illnesses” (<a href="https://www.turnbridge.com/news-events/latest-articles/age-of-mental-illness-onset/">Turnbridge</a>). Due to this fact, I decided to develop a psycological horror game for this exact reason.
